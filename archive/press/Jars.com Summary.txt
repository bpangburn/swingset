SwingSet is an open source toolkit for making Java Swing database-aware.  It was developed by Prasanth R. Pasala in conjunction with The Pangburn  Company and has been released under the BSD License.

SwingSet utilizes SSTextDocument, an extension of the standard PlainDocument class to link the JTextField or JTextArea to a database column within a RowSet.  In addition, custom classes are provided to replace the standard JComboBox and JCheckBox. The SSComboBox provides an Access-like combobox that can be used to display user-specified text choices based on an underlying numeric column (e.g. allows my_table!choice_code, an integer column with valid values of 0, 1, & 2, to be displayed as "yes," "no," & "maybe").  The SSDBComboBox operates in a similar fashion, but is used where both values and their corresponding text choices are stored in a table (e.g. my_table!part_id is stored as a foreign key, but my_table!part_name is displayed).  By writing a custom event listener, SSDBComboBox may also be used to navigate a RowSet based on a combobox selection.  The SSCheckBox allows a checkbox to be linked to an underlying numeric database column.  Finally, a SSDataNavigator class is provided to allow traversal, insertion, deletion, commit, and rollback  of a RowSet. Changes to the current record are auto-committed when a navigation takes place (also similar to Access). 

The SwingSet feature-set now includes:
1. database binding for textboxes, comboboxes, and checkboxes
2. masked editing of textboxes
3. binding of a "hidden" numeric column for comboboxes with text choices (e.g. 0, 1, & 2 are stored for "Yes," "No," & "Maybe," respectively)
4. population of comboboxes based on columns in a database query (can also be used for combobox-based record navigation)
5. a record navigator (allows for database traversal, insertion, deletion, commit, and rollback)
6. a data grid component for creating datasheet/spreadsheet/table views of queries
    (a) allows custom column headings
    (b) allows hiding of specified columns
    (c) allows disabling of specified columns
    (d) allows columns to be displayed as textboxes or comboboxes
    (e) allows addition and deletion of records
    (f) allows deletion of multiple, non-consecutive records
    (g) allows data entry "masks" to be applied to text columns

While there are several commercially available solutions that perform similar tasks, SwingSet is the first known open source solution.  Although listed as a beta, it is being used daily in various applications by the author and there are no known  bugs.  SwingSet includes full JavaDoc documentation and a detailed demo application.  Future plans include adding graphics to the record navigator and verifying correct behavior with multiple database platforms.
