Steps to follow:

1. Create a folder called Release_X.X.X_XXX in SwingSet.

2. Create folder called classes in this the release folder that we created in step 1.

3. Copy the complete directory structure and classes in the classes folder (i.e, copy
   the com folder). Also copy the images folder to this folder.

4. Create a folder called source in the folder created in step 1.

5. Copy the source code along with directory structure to the source folder.

6. Create a folder called samples in the folder created in step 1.

7. Copy the samples source and class files with the directory structure in to samples folder.
   Also copy the images directory to source directory.

8. copy the changelog.txt, FAQ.txt, and readme.txt to the folder created in step 1.

9. Now we have placed all the  required files. Lets create the docs.

10. Go to command prompt and go the the source folder created in step 4.

11. type "javadoc -d ../javadoc  com.nqadmin.swingSet" ( this will create the javadoc folder in the folder
we created in step 1 and place all the doc files in that folder.

12. Create a folder called META-INF. Copy the manifest files from prior release folder (manifest.bin.mf
& manifest.samples.mf). Now we are ready to make the jar files.

13. Go to command prompt and go the the folder created in step 1.

14. type "jar -mcvf META-INF/manifest.bin.mf swingset-bin_X.X.X_XXXX.jar  -C classes com -C classes images readme.txt ChangeLog.txt FAQ.txt" 	this will create the binaries jar file and also include the readme.txt and changelog.txt

15. type "jar -mcvf META-INF/MANIFEST.samples.mf swingset-demo_X.X.X_XXXX.jar  -C samples .  readme.txt"

16. type  "jar -cvf swingset-docs_X.X.X_XXX.jar -C javadoc . readme.txt FAQ.txt ChangeLog.txt"

17. type "jar -cvf swingset-src_X.X.X_XXX.jar -C source com  -C source images readme.txt  Changelog.txt FAQ.txt"
