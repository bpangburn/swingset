ReadMe file for the top-level swingset folder.
==============================================================================

When SwingSet was converted to a Maven project, SwingSet and it's Demo
were split into two separate modules, swingset and swingset-demo.

Each module has a fully independent pom.xml, but there is also a
swingset-parent artifact and pom.xml that can be used to manage/compile both
modules.

Unfortunately, for the most seamless integration with Eclipse, Eclipse
wants to treat swingset-parent, swingset, and swingset-demo as three
separate projects.

To view as a single project:
 1. Window->Show View->Project Explorer
 2. View Menu (down arrow/triangle)->Project Presentation->Hierarchical
 
A project overview README.md is located in the same folder as this file
(FOLDERS.txt). Detailed README.md files for swingset and swingset-demo
can be found in their respective subfolders.
