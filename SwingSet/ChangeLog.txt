==============================================================================
SwingSet 0.9.1-beta - Released 10-28-2004
==============================================================================

Changes:
    SSJdbcRowSetImpl:
        1. Calling the setType & SetConcurrency methods on the 
           JdbcRowSetImpl instance variable.


==============================================================================
SwingSet 0.9.0-beta - Released 10-26-2004
==============================================================================

Changes:
    Classes or Interfaces added in SwingSet-0.9.0:
        1. SSConnection
        2. SSRowSet
        3. SSRowSetAdapter
        4. SSJdbcRowSetImpl

    SSConnection:
        This acts as a wrapper class for Connection & supports serialization.

    SSRowSet:
        This interface is based on RowSet, with just the required functions.
        Also extends Serializable interface.

    SSRowSetAdapter:
        This class provides empty functions for SSRowSet interface functions.

    SSJdbcRowSetImpl:
        This class extends SSRowSetAdapter. This is a wrapper for JdbcRowSetImpl
        with support for serialization.

    SSComboBox:
        1. Using SSRowSet instead of RowSet.
    
    SSDBCheckBox:
        1. Using SSRowSet instead of RowSet.
    
    SSDBComboBox:

        2. Using SSConnection instead of Connection.

    SSDataGrid:
        1. Using SSRowSet instead of RowSet.

    SSTableModel:
        1. Using SSRowSet instead of RowSet.

==============================================================================
SwingSet 0.8.3-beta - Released 10-22-2004
==============================================================================

Changes:
    Classes or Interfaces added in SwingSet-0.8.3:
        1. SSTextArea.
    
    SSDataGrid:
        1.Using SSTextField as editor when a date editor is needed, rather 
          than having all the date mask code in the SSDataGrid again.
        2.New function is provided to specify default column width for grid.
        3.Column width can be specified when requesting a combo renderor.
          For this additional functions are provided for specifying column 
          width.
        4.Added getCellEditorValue function for DateEditor sub-class. Because
          of this cell values (for columns of type Date) will be returned as
          Date objects rather than as Strings.
          This would require changes in SSCellEditing interface implementations
          if String is expected as _newValue for Date columns.
        5.Calling the createDefaultColumnModel function when a new rowset is
          specified. This fixes the problem of not displaying any new columns
          being added to the rowset. (If the initial query has 2 columns and 
          then a new rowset has been specified with 3 columns DataGrid was 
          still showing only 2 columns).
          
    SSTableModel:
        1.Value for Date column can be set using a String (accepted formats
          mm/dd/yyyy or yyyy-mm-dd) or Date object.This helps the copy & paste
          functionality in copying dates.
    
    SSTextDocument:
        1.Added support for CHAR types.
        
    SSTextField:
        1.The way the masks work is modified to handle more keys.
        2.Enter key will transfer the focus to next component irrespective
          of whether the mask being used.
        3.Added focus listener to select complete text when the text field
          receives focus.


==============================================================================
SwingSet 0.8.2-beta - Released 09-21-2004
==============================================================================

Changes:
    SSDataNavigator:
        1. Changed button names in code to more meaningful names
           (e.g. button1 -> firstButton)
        2.Refresh was calling next() twice. This was causing a problem
          when the rowset has just one record.
        3.Moving to the last record when the user presses the commit
          button to save the record. This would keep the user in the
          added record.
        4.Added rowset listener to keep track of the record number,
          if the rowset is navigated out side of the navigation bar 
          (using rowset navigation methods).
        5.Displaying exception messages, if one occurs when a button
          is pressed.
    
    SSComboBox:
        1.Added support for mapping values in setDisplay function.
        2.Combo Listener was not handling mapping values so added that.
        3.Added a constant to indicate that there is no selection in combobox.
          This value will be returned when  the selected index in combo box 
          is -1.
        4.Changed the codes for MALE & FEMALE constants, also changed
          the order in which they are added to the combo.

    SSDBComboBox:
        1.Updating the numberOfItems variable in deleteItem & addItem
          functions.
           
    SSTextField:
        1.The default mask is set to nothing. Previously it was MMDDYYYY.
        
        
==============================================================================
SwingSet 0.8.1-beta - Released 08-13-2004
==============================================================================

Changes:
    SSComboBox:
        1. When the selected index in the combo box is -1 the value for that
           will be set to null in the database.
           
    SSDBComboBox:
        1. When the selected index in the combo box is -1 the value for that
           will be set to null in the database.
           
    SSDataNavigator:
        1. When a record is deleted or added to the current rowset with the 
           help of delete or add buttons on the navigator the row count
           displayed will change.
        2. Default size of the buttons has been reduced a bit and that of 
           text field and label which display current row number and row count
           has been increased.
           
           
==============================================================================
SwingSet 0.8.0-beta - Released 08-11-2004
==============================================================================

Changes:
    Classes or Interfaces added in SwingSet-0.8.0:
        1. SSTableKeyAdapter.
        
    SSCellEditingAdapter:
        1. Implements Serializable.
    
    SSComboBox:
        1. Made all the variables protected.
        2. Added getColumnName function. This function returns the column name
           to which the combo box is bound to.
        3. Added getRowSet function. This function returns the rowset being
           used for binding.
        4. Added setColumnName function. This function sets the column name to
           which the combo box has to be bound.
        5. Added setRowSet function. This function sets the rowset to be used
           for binding to the specified column.
        6. Added setSelectedValue function. This function sets the value of
           the combo box to the specified value. (Item displayed will be the
           one corresponding to the given value, the bound column value will
           also change).
        7. Added addComponent and removeListener functions. These are private
           functions.
        8. The inner classes for listeners also implement Serializable
           interface.
        
    SSDataGrid:
        1. Added functions getSelectedColumns and getSelectedColumnCount.
           Overriding the methods in JTable. This is needed to avoid the
           hidden columns being selected. This is needed for copy and paste
           support.
        2. Added copy and paste support for the SSDataGrid, this is achieved
           with the help of SSTableKeyAdapter.
        3. The default item selected in a combo box renderer when a default
           value is not specified for the column will be -1. In the previous
           release it was the first item.
    
    SSDataNavigator:
        1. Added getXXX functions for rowset, button size, modification,
           deletion, insertion, confirm deletes.
        2. Added rowCount and currentRow variables to keep track of current
           row number and total number of rows in the current rowset.
        3. Added a text field and a label to the navigator to display the
           total number of rows and current record number.
          
    SSDBCheckBox:
        1. Added a new constructor which takes a rowset and column name as
           arguments.
        2. Added  bind function which takes a rowset and column name as
           arguments.
        3. Added getColumnName function. This function returns the column name
           to which the check box is bound to.
        4. setTextField, getTextField functions are deprecated, also the
           constructor that takes a TextField as an argument is also
           deprecated
        5. Added key listener to transfer focus when enter key is pressed.
        
    SSDBComboBox:
        1. setTextField function is deprecated.
        2. Added setSelectedValue function. This function sets the selected
           item to the one corresponding to the specified value.
        3. Added key listener to transfer focus when enter key is pressed.
        4. Removing items from combo before adding new items.
    
    SSDBNavAdapter:
        1. Implements Serializable.
    
    SSDBNavImp:
        1. Default item selected in the combo box will be -1 rather than 0.
           This way the column value can be null if a value is not selected.
        
    SSTableKeyAdapter:
        1. This class added a key listener to the JTable and provides copy and
           paste support for the given JTable.
           
    SSTableModel:
        1. Made all the variables protected.
    
    SSTextDocument:
        1. Added setColumnName, setColumnIndex, and setRowSet functions.
        2. Added getColumnName, getColumnIndex, and getRowSet functions.
        3. Added bind function so find the text field to a column in the
           rowset.
        4. Added tranfer focus in the key listener. Focus will be tranferred
           to next component when enter key is pressed.
    

==============================================================================
SwingSet 0.7.0-beta - Released 02-23-2004
==============================================================================

Changes:

    SSDataNavigator:
        1. Reduced the default size of the buttons to 50 * 20.
        2. First & Last buttons will be disabled when the rowset is at first
           & last row respectively.
        3. Commit button will be enabled all the time. When rowset is on
           insert row, pressing of commit button will insert the row. When not
           on insert row it will update the present row.
        4. Button graphics have been added.
        5. Added the function setCallExecute(). This function can be used to
           indicate to the Navigator that a MySQL database is being used. If
           this is set to false, the Navigator will not call the execute()
           method on the specified rowset. See question #6 in the FAQ for
           further explanation.

    SSTextDocument:
        1. In the rowset listener, replaced the function calls remove,
           removeUpdate, insertString & insertUpdate with single function call
           replace. This seems to fix the problems of NullPointerException
           caused occasionally when the SSTextDocument is set to a JTextArea
           (NPE was occurring only when text had new line characters).

    SSComboBox:
        1. GENDER_OPTION has been added as one of the options. When this is
           used as setOption argument the combo box will display "Male" &
           "Female" as items in the combo box.

                
==============================================================================
SwingSet 0.6.0-beta - Released 12-18-2003
==============================================================================

For the 0.6.0 release of SwingSet, a grid control, SSDataGrid, has been added,
which can display database information in a "datasheet" or "spreadsheet" style
view.  SSDataGrid provides functions to set column headers, hide columns, and
make columns uneditable.  In addition, individual columns in the SSDataGrid
can be displayed as either text fields or combo boxes.  For text columns,
editing masks can be specified.  SSDataGrid uses the SSTableModel, which
extends AbstractTableModel. The SSCellEditing and SSDataValue interfaces
provide fine control over the working of the grid.

Also added in the 0.6.0 release of SwingSet is the SSTextField, which extends
the JTextField.  The SSTextField provides editing masks for data entry
(e.g. dates, social security numbers, specified number of decimals, etc.).

Classes or Interfaces added in SwingSet-0.6.0:

    1.SSCellEditing
    2.SSCellEditingAdapter
    3.SSDataGrid
