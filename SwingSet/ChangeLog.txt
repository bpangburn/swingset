SwingSet 0.6.0-beta - Released 12-18-2003
==========================================

For the 0.6.0 release of SwingSet, a grid control, SSDataGrid, has been added,
which can display database information in a "datasheet" or "spreadsheet" style
view.  SSDataGrid provides functions to set column headers, hide columns, and
make columns uneditable.  In addition, individual columns in the SSDataGrid
can be displayed as either text fields or comboboxes.  For text columns,
editing masks can be specified.  SSDataGrid uses the SSTableModel, which
extends AbstractTableModel. The SSCellEditing and SSDataValue interfaces
provide fine control over the working of the grid.

Also added in the 0.6.0 release of SwingSet is the SSTextField, which extends
the JTextField.  The SSTextField provides editing masks for data entry
(e.g. dates, social security numbers, specified number of decimals, etc.).
