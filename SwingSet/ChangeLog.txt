SwingSet 0.6.1-beta - Released 
==============================================================================

Changes:

	SSDataNavigator:
	
		1. Reduced the default size of the buttons to 50 * 20.
		2. First & Last buttons will be disabled when the rowset is at first & last row
			respectively.
		3. Commit button will be enabled all the time. When rowset is on inset row pressing
			of commit button will insert the row. When not on insert row it will update the 
			present row.
		4. Button graphics have been added.
		5. Added the function setMySQLDB(). This function can be used to indicate to the Navigator
			that MySQL database is being used. If this is set to true navigator will not call the 
			execute method on the specified rowset. The ResultSet class in the MySQL driver is not
			updatable. For updatable ResultSet UpdatableResultSet class has to be used. But
			when execute is called on the RowSet it will generate a ResultSet not UpdatableResultSet.
			So when generating a RowSet using MySQL database first generate a UpdatableResultSet
			object and then set this to the RowSet. This rowset should be used in building the 
			SSDataNavigator.
			
			Example:
				Let rs be your UpdatableResultSet object.
				JdbcRowSetImpl rowset = new JdbcRowSetImpl(rs);
				SSDataNavigator dataNavigator = new SSDataNavigator();
				dataNavigator.setMySQLDB(true);
				dataNavigator.setRowSet(rowset);
			If you want to change the query change the rs object and set it to rowset again.
			Set this new rowset to SSDataNavigator.
			
			(P.S: This is a work around provided for MySQL DB users based on the feedback from lopes.
			 see https://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?thread_id=1005899&forum_id=313186)
			 
						
	SSTextDocument:
		1. In the rowset listener replaced the function calls remove, removeUpdate, 
			insertString & insertUpdate with single function call replace.
			This seems to fix the problems of NullPointerException caused occasionally
			when the SSTextDocument is set to a JTextArea (NPE was occurring only when
			text had new line characters).
			
	SSComboBox:
		1. GENDER_OPTION has been added as one of the options. When this is used as 
			setOption argument the combo box will display "Male" & "Female"  as items
			in the combo box.

SwingSet 0.6.0-beta - Released 12-18-2003
==============================================================================

For the 0.6.0 release of SwingSet, a grid control, SSDataGrid, has been added,
which can display database information in a "datasheet" or "spreadsheet" style
view.  SSDataGrid provides functions to set column headers, hide columns, and
make columns uneditable.  In addition, individual columns in the SSDataGrid
can be displayed as either text fields or comboboxes.  For text columns,
editing masks can be specified.  SSDataGrid uses the SSTableModel, which
extends AbstractTableModel. The SSCellEditing and SSDataValue interfaces
provide fine control over the working of the grid.

Also added in the 0.6.0 release of SwingSet is the SSTextField, which extends
the JTextField.  The SSTextField provides editing masks for data entry
(e.g. dates, social security numbers, specified number of decimals, etc.).

    1.SSCellEditing
