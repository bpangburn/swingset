New Roads, LA - August 13, 2004 - We have just released version 0.8.1-beta of SwingSet to address a few small bugs in the 0.8.0-beta release.  The 0.8.0 default "empty" item for comboboxes was writing -1 rather than null to the underlying data source if another value was not selected.  In addition, the record counter recently added to the record navigator to display the total number of records was not updating as records were added or deleted.  As a small enhancement for 0.8.1, the record navigator button sizes have been resized to make better use of available space. It is recommended that anyone using 0.8.0-beta upgrade to 0.8.1-beta immediately.  See http://swingset.sourceforge.net for a detailed list of features and additional information.
