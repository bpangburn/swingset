SwingSet 1.0.0 Preview Release 3 is the first new release of SwingSet in over a year.  This release adds extra functions to the SSDBNav interface to give more control to the programmer to create & manage different events on the DataNavigator. A number of new classes have also been added in the formatting package, and work continues to finalize & document this package and its subpackages.

Although still a preview release, SwingSet has been successfully used by its developers in production software for over a year.  Project focus will now switch to improving example code & user documentation in preparation for the first release candidate.
