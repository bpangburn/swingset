SwingSet 0.9.2 fixes an issue with SSJdbcRowSetImpl.setCommand() not updating its underlying JdbcRowSetImpl.  Also support for NUMERIC types has been added and the rest of the datatype support has been unified across SSTableModel and SSTextDocument.  Currently supported datatypes are: INTEGER, SMALLINT, TINYINT (Integer); BIGINT (Long); FLOAT (Float); DOUBLE, NUMERIC (Double); BOOLEAN, BIT (Boolean); DATE (Date); CHAR, VARCHAR, LONGVARCHAR (String).  Finally a this.fireTableDataChanged() has been added to the init() method of SSTableModel to alert listeners to any changes in data.
