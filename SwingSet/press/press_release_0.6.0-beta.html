<B>Open Toolkit for Making Java Swing Database-Aware</B>
<p>New Roads, LA - December 19, 2003 - We are pleased to announce the 0.6.0-beta release of SwingSet, an open source Java toolkit that allows the standard Java Swing components to be made database-aware. The latest release includes utilities for developing data grids, so that datasheet/spreadsheet/table views of database queries can be added to Java graphical user interfaces (GUI's). Version 0.6.0 also adds "masked" editing of text to provide greater control over user input.
<p>The SwingSet feature-set now includes:
<OL>
<LI>database binding for textboxes, comboboxes, and checkboxes
<LI>masked editing of textboxes
<LI>binding of a "hidden"numeric column for comboboxes with text choices (e.g. 0, 1, & 2 are stored for "Yes," "No," & "Maybe," respectively)
<LI>population of comboboxes based o­n columns in a database query (can also be used for combobox-based record navigation)
<LI>a record navigator (allows for database traversal, insertion, deletion, commit, and rollback)
<LI>a data grid component for creating datasheet/spreadsheet/table views of queries
<OL type=a>
<LI>allows custom column headings
<LI>allows hiding of specified columns
<LI>allows disabling of specified columns
<LI>allows columns to be displayed as textboxes or comboboxes
<LI>allows addition and deletion of records
<LI>allows deletion of multiple, non-consecutive records
<LI>allows data entry "masks" to be applied to text columns
</OL>
</OL>
<P>While there are several commercially available solutions that perform similar tasks, SwingSet is the first known open source solution.
