New Roads, LA - August 11, 2004 - We are pleased to announce the 0.8.0-beta release of SwingSet, an open source Java toolkit that allows the standard Java Swing components to be made database aware. For the latest version all components have been made into Java Beans which will allow for better integration with Java IDEs.  Major usability enhancements include cut & paste support from the data grid to/from spreadsheet programs and/or other data grids, addition of current record index and total record count to the data navigator, and default selection of an "empty" item for comboboxes.  Finally, the 0.8.0 release includes a number of smaller bug fixes, enhancements, and code improvements. See http://swingset.sourceforge.net for a detailed list of features and additional information.
