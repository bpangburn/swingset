1.  I am trying to run the samples. I see "Processing....." and nothing
	happens.

Ans: You might be missing one or more jar files. 
		  Please make sure that you have the following jar files.
		1.swingSet.jar
		2.rowset.jar    ( You have to download it from java.sun.com)
		3.pg73jdbc3.jar ( Driver for postgresql database (remote database)
			that the application uses)

	If you still have the problem.
	Unzip the jar file and extract the files to a folder.
	From command prompt go to that folder and type 
		 java  MainClass
	Now you can see any errors on your command prompt screen.
	
2.	I have set the headers but I don't see them on the screen.

Ans: You have to set the headers before you set the rowset. If you reverse
	the order you will not see the headers. So if you want to set the 
	headers use the empty constructor.

3.	I am getting an exception while setting the renderers.

Ans: You have to set the renderer only after you have set the rowset.
	Till you set the rowset the JTable does not have any columns. So when
	you try to set a renderer SSDataGrid tries to access the specified 
	column from JTable causing an exception.
	

4. What happens to my default values and all other stuff I have set when I change
	my underlying RowSet?

Ans: All the defaults and other information like headers, renderer will remain the 
	same even after changing the RowSet for the SSDataGrid. If you want to change
	any thing or unset them you have to call the setXXXXXXX functions to change the 
	behaviour.
	Example: You have a RowSet and set the default value for column 3 to be "XYZ".
	Now you have changed your query for the RowSet and set it to SSDataGrid now you 
	have to call the setDefaultValues  like this
		dataGrid.setDefaultValues(null,null);
	This will remove all the default values used.
	
5. I have the same query in my rowset but my renderer, hidden columns are not working
	in the right way.
	
Ans: When you say the same query the order in which columns are selected should also 
	remain the same. When you set a renderer, specify a column as hidden you specify
	either column number or column name (in which case swing set internally converts
	them to column number). Now if you change the selection order in the query and 
	specify the new rowset to the swing set it still has the old column numbers. So 
	you have to specify the new hidden columns and uneditable columns.
