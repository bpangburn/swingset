Frequently Asked Questions file for the SwingSet Open Toolkit for Java Swing.
==============================================================================

1.  I am trying to compile and run the demo/samples. I see "Processing....",
    and nothing happens. What is wrong?

    You may be missing a required dependency jar. See the README.txt file in
    the swingset-demo-x.y.z.jar file for detailed instructions on running
    the demo. The demo README.txt should also be available from:
    https://sourceforge.net/p/swingset/code/ci/master/tree/swingset-demo/README.txt
        

2.  I have set the headers for a SSDataGrid, so why I don't see them on the
    screen?

    You have to set the headers before you set the rowset. If you reverse the
    order, you will not see the headers.  If you want to specify headers, use
    the empty constructor.


3.  Why am I getting an exception, while setting the renderers.

    You have to set the renderers only after you have set the rowset.  Until
    you set the rowset the JTable does not have any columns, so when you try
    to set a renderer SSDataGrid tries to access the specified column from
    JTable, which causes an exception.
        

4.  What happens to my default values and any other custom settings when I
    change my underlying rowset?

    All the defaults and other information like headers, renderer will remain
    the same even after changing the rowset for a SSDataGrid. If you want to
    change any settings or remove the defaults and/or headers, you have to
    call the setXXXXX() functions to change the behavior.
    
    Example: You have a rowset for a SSDataGrid and have set the default value
             for the third column to be "XYZ". If you then change the query
             for the rowset and want to remove the defaults for the SSDataGrid,
             you have to call the setDefaultValues() method like this:
                 dataGrid.setDefaultValues(null,null);
                 
             This will remove all the default values used.
        
5.  I setup a SSDataGrid based on a rowset querying columns "X," "Y," and "Z."
    I made a small change to the underlying query but return the same set of 
    columns. Why are my renderers and/or hidden columns not working as
    expected?
    
    When modifying a query for a SSDataGrid's rowset, you must insure that the 
    columns are returned in the same order! When you set a renderer, or
    specify a column as hidden you specify either a column number or column
    name (in which case SwingSet internally converts the name to a column 
    number).  If you change the column ordering for the underlying query and 
    apply the modified rowset to your SSDataGrid, SwingSet continues to use
    the "old" column numbers for any renderers or hidden columns.  You will
    have to supply new renderers/hidden columns for the reordered columns.
    
    
6. I'm having trouble getting SwingSet to work with MySQL.  Are there any
   special instructions?

   SwingSet has been tested with mysql's "connector/j 8.0" driver; which is
   compatible with mysql servers 5.6, 5.7, 8.0.

   There are report of problems with very old versions of the mysql jdbc driver.
   See http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?thread_id=1005899&forum_id=313186
     
7. I see that SSJdbcRowSetImpl and SSRowSet have been deprecated.

   SwingSet has been modified to allow for any RowSet implementation.
   
   For JDBC 1.8+ we recommend https://github.com/bpangburn/jdbcrowsetimpl
   
   com.nqadmin.swingset.datasources.RowSetOps has been added with static
   methods to replace any custom/convenience functions in SSJdbcRowSetImpl.
