New Roads, LA - October 22, 2004 - We have just released version 0.8.3-beta of SwingSet with several bugfixes and usability enhancements for the 0.8.X series.  A SSTextArea has been added to extend the JTextArea with a rowset binding.  The SSDataGrid has been enhanced with improvements for date rendering, setting of default column widths, and display of new columns.  The SSTextField has improved keystroke handling and now selects all text by default upon receiving the focus.  Finally the SwingSet SSTextDocument has been modified to support the CHAR datatype.

The 0.8.3 release is the last planned release in the 0.8.X series.  The 0.9.0 release will follow shortly and will contain a new serialized datasource abstraction layer.  This will greatly facilitate serialization/deserialization of the various SwingSet components and will pave the way for SwingSet compatibility with non-updatable rowsets and other non-database datasources.  Unfortunately, applications written for 0.8.X and earlier versions of SwingSet will require some small changes related to database connections and rowset objects in order to work with the 0.9.X and later versions.  We will make every effort to constrain and minimize the required changes.  The 0.8.3 release should supply developers with the latest fixes and provide the maximum migration time as 0.8.3 and 0.9.0 should be identical in all aspects other than the new datasource abstraction layer.
